= Bugs and Shortcomings

There are a couple of well known, long-standing issues with
Alexandria. These issues will, hopefully, be addressed in upcoming
releases. There are also specific bugs tracked on RubyForge:
<http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=205>

== Icon Display Spacing

While the list view of books is naturally neat, the default icon view
suffers from problematic icon spacing; often the book covers appear to
be randomly scattered. They cannot even be adjusted afterwards. This
is just an aesthetic concern, but a frustrating one.

It is probable that this is due to inconsistent use of the GTK+ thread
dispatcher is at the root of these problems. Hopefully future
development can clean up the code in this regard.

== Multiple Copies of Books

The limited expressiveness of Alexandria's domain model means that it
is not possible to keep a record of more than one copy of a given book
in a single library.

== Large Collections

The user-interface becomes slow and unresponsive when dealing with
libraries over about 100 books. This is quite a low threshold on
scalability. The simple solution is to make a couple of new libraries
to hold a hundred books each; a common approach is to split them up
according to broad subject area.

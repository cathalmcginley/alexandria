The sound files for Alexandria are generated using CSound, a free (GNU
LGPL) "sound design, music synthesis, and signal processing system".
http://www.csounds.com/

Because most users won't have CSound installed, the generated audio
files are also distributed as part of the source. You can find them
under data/sounds/alexandria, and they will be installed in
/usr/share/sounds/alexandria

These sounds are released under the same license as Alexandria (GNU
GPL v2+), (so if you redistribute the generated sound files, you must
make the csd source available as specified under the GPL).
